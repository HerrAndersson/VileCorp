The "make installer.nsi" script is compiled using NSIS 3.0b3.
The NSIS compiler is located in "Google Drive\Stort spelprojekt\Tools\nsis-3.0b3-setup.exe"
or at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download

When compiled the script will package the contents of "Output\Bin\x86\Release"
so make sure that you have built the game in release before compiling the script.

On completion of the script the file "setup_vile_corp_1.0.exe" should have been created in the "\Tools\Installer" folder.
